      The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on August 18, 2008. On October
      31, 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A
      Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing
      list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and
      released it in January 2009. Nakamoto's identity remains unknown. On 3
      January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the
      starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block. Embedded in the
      coinbase of this block was the text The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on
      brink of second bailout for banks"

      This note references a headline published by The Times and has been
      interpreted as both a timestamp and a comment on the instability caused by
      fractional-reserve banking. The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction
      was cypherpunk Hal Finney, who had created the first reusable
      proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004. Finney downloaded the bitcoin
      software on its release date, and on 12 January 2009 received ten bitcoins
      from Nakamoto. Other early cypherpunk supporters were creators of bitcoin
      predecessors: Wei Dai, creator of b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bit
      gold.

      In 2010, the first known commercial transaction. using bitcoin occurred
      when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for â‚¿10,000.

      Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million
      bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key
      and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later
      became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Andresen then sought to
      decentralize control. This left opportunity for controversy to develop
      over the future development path of bitcoin, in contrast to the perceived
      authority of Nakamoto's contributions.
