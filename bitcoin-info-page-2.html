<h3>Bitcoin is increasingly talked about, but why do people like it so much?</h3>

<p><strong>Bitcoin is totally open, and free software.</strong> Anyone can see its <strong>source code</strong>, study it, audit it or improve it. Hundreds of people improve it daily: Some of the smartest brains on the planet improve it daily under an environment of democratic consensus.
   <strong>On Github</strong> you can see how hundreds of people from all over the planet are collaborating without receiving anything in return. Even, if you want, you can copy it and start a new cryptocurrency (there are thousands of clones with interesting changes, but also copies without any innovation).</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, no one can generate thousands of bitcoins one morning because a politician or a banker suddenly feels like it. There will never be more than 21 million and they all appear for mining, always under rules that are totally public.</p>
<p><strong>Another advantage of Bitcoin is that no person can access money without your consent.</strong> Thus reducing the risk of theft. In addition, you will save expenses (since you do not need a box, or a safe, or companies that transport your money to a bank), you will speed up the speed of payments and improve the quality of work of employees. They will not have to waste time counting money, nor will they be burdened in tasks dedicated to management and maintenance.</p>
