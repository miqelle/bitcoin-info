  <h3>3 quick facts about Bitcoin:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bitcoin (₿) is a decentralized digital currency.</li>
    <li>It can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.</li>
    <li>It was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name <strong>Satoshi
        Nakamoto</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Bitcoin Creation Story</h3>
  <p>The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on August 18, 2008. On October 31, 2008, a link to a paper authored by
    Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list.
    Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009. Nakamoto's identity
    remains unknown.</p>

  <p>On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as
    the genesis block. Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the text "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of
    second bailout for banks". This note references a headline published by The Times and has been interpreted as both a
    timestamp and a comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.</p>
  <p>The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypherpunk Hal Finney, who had created the first reusable
    proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software on its release date, and on 12 January
    2009 received ten bitcoins from Nakamoto. Other early cypherpunk supporters were creators of bitcoin predecessors:
    Wei Dai, creator of b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bit gold. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction
    using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for ₿10,000.
  </p>
  <p>Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he
    handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later became lead
    developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Andresen then sought to decentralize control. This left opportunity for
    controversy to develop over the future development path of bitcoin, in contrast to the perceived authority of
    Nakamoto's contributions.</p>
